# Elastik Scheduling Problem for Loraine and Charles

Loraine and Charles have a nearly 3-year-old child! Although their child is more independent now, scheduling activities and household tasks remains challenging for them. They have a list of `N` daily activities. Each activity occurs within a specified time interval. They must assign each activity to one of them, ensuring that neither person is responsible for two overlapping activities. An activity ending at time `t` does not overlap with another starting at time `t`.

For example, suppose Loraine and Charles need to cover three activities: one from 18:00 to 20:00, another from 19:00 to 21:00, and another from 22:00 to 23:00. One option is for Charles to handle the activity from 19:00 to 21:00 while Loraine covers the other two. Another valid schedule could have Loraine covering the activity from 18:00 to 20:00, with Charles covering the other two. Note that the first two activities overlap between 19:00 and 20:00, so they cannot be assigned to the same person.

Given the start and end times of each activity, find any schedule where the same person doesnâ€™t handle overlapping activities, or state that it is impossible.

## Input

- The first line of input specifies the number of test cases, `T`.
- Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer `N`, indicating the number of activities to be assigned.
- Then, `N` lines follow. The `i`-th line (starting from 1) contains two integers `Si` and `Ei`.
  - The `i`-th activity starts exactly `Si` minutes after midnight and ends exactly `Ei` minutes after midnight.

## Output

For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where `x` is the test case number (starting from 1) and `y` is `IMPOSSIBLE` if there is no valid schedule according to the above rules, or a string of exactly `N` characters otherwise. The `i`-th character in `y` must be `C` if the `i`-th activity is assigned to Loraine in your proposed schedule, and `J` if it is assigned to Charles.

## To run
1. Install nodeJS
1. `run node scheduler-task.js` and follow the input prompts as decribed above.
